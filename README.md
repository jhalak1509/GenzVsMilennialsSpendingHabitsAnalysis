The objective of our database project is to help businesses and organizations with our analysis of Gen Z vs Milennials and their purchase trends, including what influences the purchase. The goal is to help businesses come up with the right products and strategies focusing on the more important details, leading to an increase in sales.
A few of many questions that we would like to answer from our analysis would be:
1. What do they spend the most on? (Food, Clothing, Travel, Electronics, Entertainment)
2. How often do they eat out?
3. What is a more convenient purchase option for them? (Mobile App, Website)
4. What is their preferred mode of shopping? (Physical Store, Online Store)
5. Do they refer to reviews before making the purchase?
6. Do they spend more on? (Comfort, Luxury)
